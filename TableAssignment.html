    <h4>Conclusions</h4>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Lost Angels is the most parrot-populated city in the world, since it has a total number of 90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000051119
 red, yellow, and green parrots.</li>
        <li>It's kind of harsh to make parrots illegal, like who doesn't like them? However, I'm not a president to decide this. I feel bad for Washyourtonguers anyway.</li>
        <li>It was a cool idea to make up all the information, but I don't know if I would do that again.</li>
